**Bookstore API**

This is a simple Bookstore API built with Flask. It allows users to manage books through basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

**Requirements**
Python

Flask

Postman (for API testing, optional)

**Testing the API with Postman**

You can use Postman to test the API endpoints. Hereâ€™s how:

Import the Bookstore API Postman Collection file into Postman.

Use the pre-configured requests in the Postman collection to interact with the API:

GET /books to retrieve the list of books.

POST /books to add a new book.

PUT /books/{id} to update the details of a specific book.

DELETE /books/{id} to remove a book from the collection.
